# Swift-Banking-System

The management of customer accounts, balances, and deposits poses a complex and time-consuming challenge for banking institutions, with potential financial losses and reputational damage resulting from inadequate management. Banks face several obstacles when managing customer accounts, balances, and deposits including managing multiple accounts, large customer base,complex transactions, security risks etc.

To manage customer accounts, balances, and deposits more efficiently, reduce errors, and provide better customer service, it is essential for banks to use a centralized database system. The proposed solution is the implementation of a Swift Bank Management System to streamline banking operations and enhance the customer experience.
